## Install Instructions
###Â Step One
Install this using Composer by adding the following to your shell.
```sh
composer require fredbradley/slacklogs
```
Or if you're the type of person that likes to edit the `composer.json` file directly, then add in: 
```json
"fredbradley/slacklogs": "^1.2.*"
```

### Step Two
Add the Service Provider to you `config/app.php`.
In `config/app.php`, at the bottom of the array where it lists all the 'providers', add in:
```php
FredBradley\CranleighSchool\SlackServiceProvider::class
```
Remember to ensure there's no trailing comma at the end of the array, but that there is one on the line above!
